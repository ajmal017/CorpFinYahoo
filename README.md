Stock Volatility Visualization Dashboard Using Bokeh
The scope of this project is to create an interactive dashboard to visualize the stock behaviors of different companies over time, and calculate the stock volatility against S&P stock index. To achieve these goals, the following code is written in Python using Bokeh, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries.
Currently, the dataset for different stocks should be downloaded manually; in the next update of this platform, the data will be accessed through Yahoo Finance API in real time. Also, using Yahoo API will make the platform more scalable, since the user can access stock information of every public company in the United States.
